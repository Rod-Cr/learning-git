                His hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to his most recent success at Amazon. There he started his first project to install servers. He finished his project in 6 weeks and went to help logistics for three weeks, because his team finished three weeks early.
                
                Rod believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to success, a tenet he lives out through his interests in swimming, running, gaming, and drawing.
